			<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h3 id="motivation">Motivation</h3>
<p>Cable Wakeboarding is an extreme water sport where participants (riders) are pulled (at speeds of 30+ kph) around a lake by an overhead cable (very similar to a cable car system). Much like skate parks, wake parks have obstacles (such as jumps and rails) built along the cable path. In competition, riders are judged subjectively on their ability to perform ticks (such as flips) both on and off these obstacles. There are 700+ Wakeparks in the world (60+ in Asia).</p>
<p><a href="http://www.singaporewakepark.com/home/">Singapore Wakepark</a> (SWP) and other parks host about 4 competitions per year with an average turn out of 100 riders and 300 spectators with a SGD 60 admission fee. A typical competition consists of several disciplines (e.g. “Men’s Beginner”) containing rounds and heats (e.g. “Round 2 - Semi Final 1”). Riders are scored and ranked in each round,  hoping to progress to the final, where the top 3 are awarded a price (1st place upwards of SGD 1000).</p>
<p>For competition organizers there are currently 2 options when it comes to managing a competition;</p>
<ol>
<li>Pay a federation to manage the competition and use their event management system. Disadvantages;
<ul>
<li>Yearly member subscription fees</li>
<li>Percentage taken from rider admission fees</li>
<li>Can only use judges affiliated with the federation (sometimes judges need to be flown in at an expense to the park)</li>
<li>Little control over the structure of competition</li>
<li>The applications provided by federations are not very good; not mobile optimized, results are not pushed automatically (need to refresh page), results are not real-time</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Manage the competition on your own. Receiving admissions by email, manually creating heat tables using excel, sharing screen shots of start lists on Facebook, then printing round results and pinning them on a notice board. Disadvantages;
<ul>
<li>Very time consuming and rigid format</li>
<li>Very little feedback to interested parties on the state of the competition as it takes place (e.g. current round results, next round start list)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="my-goals">My Goals</h3>
<p>I am building a web application to be used by organizers, riders, judges and spectators with the following goals;</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide a cheap, intuitive and flexible workflow to organizers for creating and hosting competitions</li>
<li>Give maximum control to organizers over their competition structure (number of disciplines, number of heats per round etc.)</li>
<li>Give real-time monitoring metrics to interested parties. E.g. how long will a competition take, is it running behind schedule (adverse weather can delay a schedule)</li>
<li>Give real-time feedback to interested parties on the state of a competition (e.g: how many points the current rider needs to proceed to the next round). This is particularly useful for competition commentators who rely on this real-time information to keep the spectators engaged and excited</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="solution">Solution</h2>
<h3 id="my-stakeholders">My Stakeholders</h3>
<p>All those involved in Wakeboard Competitions;</p>
<ul>
<li>Organizers e.g. Singapore Wakepark Owner</li>
<li>Riders</li>
<li>Spectators (mostly the families of riders, especially younger riders who often have a whole family to support them)</li>
<li>Judges</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="requirements">Requirements</h3>
<p>After talking to my stakeholders, here are some of the key features of the app I am building;</p>
<ul>
<li>As an organizer I want to create competitions and heats</li>
<li>As an organizer I want to assign starting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seed_(sports)">seeds</a> to riders</li>
<li>As an organizer I want to allocate registered riders into the first round <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/qualifying%20heat">heats</a></li>
<li>As a rider I want to sign up to a competition</li>
<li>As a rider I want to see all the competitions and heats I am assigned to</li>
<li>As a rider I want to track my overall progression in real-time (as soon as a result comes in from the judges I should receive a notification with my updated place on the scoreboard)</li>
<li>As a judge I want to see the current heat I am scoring</li>
<li>As a judge I want to be able to input scores for riders as they compete</li>
<li>As a judge I want to be able to end a heat and have riders allocated automatically to the next round (based on the competition structure defined by the organizer)</li>
<li>As a user I want to track the overall progression of all riders in real-time</li>
<li>As a user I want to see real-time metrics. E.g. is a competition running behind schedule</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="my-tools">My Tools</h2>
<h3 id="amazon-web-services">Amazon Web Services</h3>
<p>I am are making use of several cloud services and tools provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS), which offer;</p>
<ul>
<li>High scalability and availability</li>
<li>Pay as you use payment model (when no competitions are running the cost of running the application will be negligible)</li>
<li>Many libraries, packages and tools available to do much of the heavy lifting involved in building modern, robust applications</li>
</ul>
<p>I am making use of the following AWS tools and services;</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-cli">AWS Amplify CLI</a>, to rapidly provision and configure my cloud services</li>
<li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/">Amazon Cognito</a>, to handle user sign up and authorization</li>
<li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/">Amazon DynamoDB</a>, to provide millisecond response times to API queries for competition and rider data</li>
<li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/appsync/">AWS AppSync</a>, to host a GraphQL API for my front end</li>
<li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/">AWS Lambda</a>, to support some of the more specific GraphQL queries and mutations (e.g: building a competition from a set of parameters)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="reactjs">ReactJS</h3>
<p>I am building my application front end using ReactJS, which offers;</p>
<ul>
<li>A robust and flexible approach to handling dynamic content and rich stateful interactions (e.g. managing and rendering competition state)</li>
<li>A really fun development experience. Many developers, including myself, really enjoy ReactJS programming. This also ensures a rich and growing ecosystem of React libraries and tools to support present and future development</li>
<li>Potential to create a React Native Mobile App in the future, while reusing (and not replacing) a lot of solution code</li>
</ul>
<p>I am making use of the following ReactJS libraries and tools;</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.amplify.aws/">AWS Amplify</a>, to connect to cloud resources</li>
<li><a href="https://aws-amplify.github.io/">Redux</a>, to store competition state and share it among components</li>
<li><a href="https://redux-saga.js.org/">Redux Saga</a>, to handle side effects (e.g accessing the GraphQL API) when updating competition state</li>
<li><a href="https://material-ui.com/">Material UI</a>, to make use of many out of the box UI components with a common theme and appearance</li>
<li><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios">Axios</a>, to write lightweight and easily configurable REST API calls to the Cognito Admin Queries API (e.g; getUsersInRole)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="architecture">Architecture</h2>
<p>Here’s a map of the services and tools I am using and how they connect to each-other.</p>
